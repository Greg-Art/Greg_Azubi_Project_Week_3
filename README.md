# Greg_Azubi_Project_Week_3
This is my first Power BI Project 
During Week 3 of the Azubi Data Analytics Program, we were tasked to create a dashboard on Power BI 

The dashboard had to display the following information about our Linkedln profile:

Total connections
Total invitations sent 
Total invitation received.
Total companies
Total reactions
Total no. of messages sent 
Total connections by month
Total connections by company 
Total connections by positions
